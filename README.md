### The Missing UI for Claude Code

Put Claude Code in your pocket — the open-source desktop client that makes Claude Code's power accessible to everyone. No terminal, ever.

**Our philosophy:** Wrap complex technology into intuitive human interaction.

## Why Halo?

**Claude Code is the most capable AI coding agent available.** But there's a problem:

> **It's trapped in a terminal.**

For developers comfortable with CLI, that's fine. But for designers, PMs, students, and anyone who just wants AI to *do things* — the terminal is a wall.

**Halo breaks down that wall.**

We took 100% of Claude Code's Agent capabilities and wrapped them in a visual interface that anyone can use. Same power, zero friction.

| | Claude Code CLI | Halo |
|---|:---:|:---:|
| Full Agent capabilities | ✅ | ✅ |
| Visual interface | ❌ | ✅ |
| One-click install | ❌ | ✅ |
| Remote access from any device | ❌ | ✅ |
| File preview & management | ❌ | ✅ |
| Built-in AI Browser | ❌ | ✅ |

> Think of it like this:
> **Windows** turned DOS into visual desktops.
> **Halo** turns Claude Code CLI into a visual AI companion.

## Features

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### Real Agent Loop
Not just chat. Halo can **actually do things** — write code, create files, run commands, and iterate until the task is done.

### Space System
Isolated workspaces keep your projects organized. Each Space has its own files, conversations, and context.

### Beautiful Artifact Rail
See every file AI creates in real-time. Preview code, HTML, images — all without leaving the app.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### Remote Access
Control your desktop Halo from your phone or any browser. Work from anywhere — even from a hospital bed (true story).

### AI Browser
Let AI control a real embedded browser. Web scraping, form filling, testing — all automated.

### MCP Support
Extend capabilities with Model Context Protocol. Compatible with Claude Desktop MCP servers.

### Build from Source

For developers who want to contribute or customize:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openkursar/hello-halo.git
cd hello-halo
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## Quick Start

1. **Launch Halo** and enter your API key (Anthropic recommended)
2. **Start chatting** — try "Create a simple todo app with React"
3. **Watch the magic** — see files appear in the Artifact Rail
4. **Preview & iterate** — click any file to preview, ask for changes

> **Pro tip:** For best results, use Claude Sonnet 4.5.5 or Opus 4.5.5 models.

- **100% Local** — Your data never leaves your machine (except API calls)
- **No Backend Required** — Pure desktop client, use your own API keys
- **Real Agent Loop** — Tool execution, not just text generation

## What People Are Building

Halo isn't just for developers. We've seen:

- **Finance teams** building full-stack apps from scratch — with zero coding experience
- **Designers** prototyping interactive mockups
- **Students** learning to code with AI as their pair programmer
- **Developers** shipping features faster than ever

The barrier isn't AI capability anymore. **It's accessibility.** Halo removes that barrier.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Framework | Electron + electron-vite |
| Frontend | React 18 + TypeScript |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui patterns |
| State | Zustand |
| Agent Core | @anthropic-ai/claude-code SDK |
| Markdown | react-markdown + highlight.js |

## The Story Behind Halo

A few months ago, it started with a simple frustration: **I wanted to use Claude Code, but I was stuck in meetings all day.**

During boring meetings (we've all been there), I thought: *What if I could control Claude Code on my home computer from my phone?*

Then came another problem — my non-technical colleagues wanted to try Claude Code after seeing what it could do. But they got stuck at installation. *"What's npm? How do I install Node.js?"* Some spent days trying to figure it out.

So I built Halo for myself:
- **Visual interface** — no more staring at terminal output
- **One-click install** — no Node.js, no npm, just download and run
- **Remote access** — control from phone, tablet, or any browser

The first version took a few hours. Everything after that? **100% built by Halo itself.** We've been using it daily for months.

AI building AI. Now in everyone's hands.
