    `Extract text from local image files using an on-device OCR engine. Reads each image by absolute path and returns its recognized text.

This runs entirely on your machine (tesseract.js), consumes ZERO model tokens, and never uploads image content. It recognizes English and Simplified Chinese. It extracts text only — it does NOT describe or interpret what an image depicts.

When to use:
- Reading text from many local images (screenshots, scans, photos of documents) — far cheaper than attaching each image to the conversation.
- Verbatim, character-accurate extraction of long text, tables, or mixed Chinese/English content.
- Reading text from images when the current model has no vision capability.

When NOT to use:
- Understanding image content, layout, charts, or diagrams (attach the image to the conversation for a vision model instead).
- Chinese recognition is serviceable but not exact; treat the output as a best-effort transcription.

Returns: the extracted text per file, each under a "## <path>" heading. Files with no detectable text or that fail to read are reported inline without aborting the batch.`,
