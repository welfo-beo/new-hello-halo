/**
 * AI Terminal - Shell resolution (policy; runs in the main process)
 *
 * Resolves the default interactive shell per platform into a ResolvedShellSpec
 * the pty-host worker can execute verbatim. Kept in main because policy may
 * consult main-only facilities; the worker never decides which shell to run.
 *
 * Windows default is PowerShell — the standard default shell on Windows. It
 * matters beyond familiarity: `ssh` then resolves to the native Windows OpenSSH
 * (System32), not Git Bash's MSYS ssh, whose emulated socket layer breaks
 * inside VDI virtual-network stacks (10s disconnect + wedged raw mode); and
 * PowerShell starts as a single process, unlike Git Bash `--login` whose MSYS
 * init forks dozens of processes (10s+ open time under endpoint scanning).
 * Git Bash remains reachable via an explicit `preferred` path.
 *
 * Command-completion strategy: we do NOT inject prompt hacks into the user's
 * shell. Per-shell PS1/PROMPT_COMMAND rewriting is fragile (quoting differs
 * across bash/zsh/fish, breaks under ConPTY, mangles custom prompts) and would
 * pollute the very screen the AI reads. Instead the session detects command
 * boundaries with a shell-agnostic output-idle heuristic — the same mechanism
 * the remote/SSH path needs anyway.
 *
 * OSC 133 markers are still PARSED opportunistically (worker session registers
 * the handler): if a shell or remote host already emits them, we get precise
 * boundaries + exit codes for free. We just never inject them ourselves.
